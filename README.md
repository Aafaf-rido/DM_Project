# DM_Project : Anime recommandation system
## Approaches
In this project, we are workin on a recommendation system problem using an anime dataset which has two csv files:
**anime.csv:** Contains metadata about the anime (e.g., genre, type, rating, number of episodes).
**rating.csv:** Contains ratings from users for different anime (user-item interactions).

! data cleaning: 
for the users: keep only the users with plus than 3 rating 

for the anime: keep only the anime with more than 10 ratings 

Insure that the tdata is representative

### 1. Content-based filtering (CBF)
